sbopen12
========


Site for a contest. Very similar in functionality to gothiaopen12, but uses jQuery (and Ajax). It is quite a mess...

This is a snapshot of the site from sometime in the beginning of the contest. The site was developed on the go so some functionality is missing. For example, the results are hard-coded. I simply cannot find the final version of the site.

Will find somewhere to host this.
