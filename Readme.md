sbopen12
========


Site for a bowling contest. Very similar in functionality to gothiaopen12, but uses jQuery (and Ajax). It is quite a mess... **gothiaopen12 is more recent and overall better structured and robust.**

This is a snapshot of the site from sometime in the beginning of the contest. The site was developed on the go so some functionality is missing. For example, the results are hard-coded. I simply cannot find the final version of the site. It actually seems this version is *not even a complete snapshot* so things may fail.

The site is hosted for demonstrative purposes at [http://sbopen12.atwebpages.com](http://sbopen12.atwebpages.com).
